# Zomato Data Analysis and Visualization Project

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a global dataset encompassing restaurant chains. The aim was to perform descriptive and statistical analysis to gain insights into various aspects of the restaurant industry.

## Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle and owned by Zomato, includes key information such as the average cost for two, location, votes, aggregate rating, cuisines, country, and rating text. The analysis focused on identifying top cuisines, the most expensive restaurants, average ratings by country, and other critical metrics.

## Analysis Process
1. **Data Loading:** Imported the raw data for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Utilized Python libraries like NumPy and pandas to perform data cleaning, including:
   - Dropping unnecessary columns.
   - Removing duplicate rows.
   - Cleaning individual row entries.
3. **Data Preparation:** Ensured the dataset was clean and ready for the development of an interactive dashboard.

## Key Analysis Questions
